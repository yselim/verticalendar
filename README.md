# Welcome to your new ignited app!

> The latest and greatest boilerplate for Infinite Red opinions

This is the boilerplate that [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red) uses as a way to test bleeding-edge changes to our React Native stack.

- [Quick start documentation](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/boilerplate/Boilerplate.md)
- [Full documentation](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/README.md)

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run start
```

To make things work on your local simulator, or on your phone, you need first to [run `eas build`](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/expo/EAS.md). We have many shortcuts on `package.json` to make it easier:

```bash
pnpm run build:ios:sim # build for ios simulator
pnpm run build:ios:device # build for ios device
pnpm run build:ios:prod # build for ios device
```

### `./assets`

This directory is designed to organize and store various assets, making it easy for you to manage and use them in your application. The assets are further categorized into subdirectories, including `icons` and `images`:

```tree
assets
├── icons
└── images
```

**icons**
This is where your icon assets will live. These icons can be used for buttons, navigation elements, or any other UI components. The recommended format for icons is PNG, but other formats can be used as well.

Ignite comes with a built-in `Icon` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/boilerplate/app/components/Icon.md).

**images**
This is where your images will live, such as background images, logos, or any other graphics. You can use various formats such as PNG, JPEG, or GIF for your images.

Another valuable built-in component within Ignite is the `AutoImage` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/Components-AutoImage.md).

How to use your `icon` or `image` assets:

```typescript
import { Image } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Image source={require('assets/images/my_image.png')} />
  );
};
```

--- LISTS SCREEN ---
- This screen should have 2 tabs too. Add a tab selector. Tab titles should be just "1" and "2" and each should take %50 width of the covering wrapper.
- Show a floating action button : "+" at the bottom right (It should be visible from each tab.)
- When pressed show a full screen list editor. show cancel and save buttons at  the top. when user press save, save the list to database (Also save the tab id so that we can fetch tab lists from that id)
- Lists must have a title and list items. 
- When a list is saved close the list editing screen
- User can add list items, delete list items with slide similar to DayScreen



---- DİĞER YAPILACAKLAR ---
- Tüm geçmiş item'lar ve tüm gelecek item'lar tek listede görülebilmeli
- Renkleri düzelt
- alarm sesi seçilebilmeli (Tüm itemlar için ve tek bir item için ayrı ayrı değişebilmeli)
- keyboard otomatik açıldığında altta boşluk kalıyor.
- Listeler ekranında bi listeyi komple kopyala/yapıştır gibi bişey olmalı. Tatile çıkarken yapılacaklar listesini falan kopyalayabilmeliyim.
- Database yedeği alma. Backup/restore olmalı. (Bunu buluta da gönderebilir. beli bir formatta olur, onu yükler geri.) Bunu için settings screen olacak.
